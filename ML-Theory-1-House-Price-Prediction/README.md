## 🧩 Problem Statement
Predicting house prices is a regression problem where the goal is to estimate a continuous target variable (price) based on features like area, bedrooms, and location.  
This experiment demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## 🔍 Methodology

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**  
   - Inspect dataset structure, check missing values, and explore basic statistics.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values, encode categorical features, normalize data if needed.

3. **Model Training**  
   - Train regression models using Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression, optionally others)

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Metrics: MAE, RMSE, R²  
   - Analyze where the model performs well or struggles

5. **Visualization**  
   - Scatter plots of actual vs predicted values  
   - Regression line plots
