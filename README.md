## 📘 **Machine Learning**



Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that enables systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.
This subject focuses on **data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and understanding learning behavior such as underfitting and overfitting**.
